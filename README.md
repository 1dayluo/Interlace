# Variable Replacements
The following varaibles will be replaced in commands at runtime:

| Variable  | Replacement                                                             |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| \_output\_   | Replaced with the output folder variable from interlace              |
| \_port\_     | Replaced with the port variable from interlace                       |
| \_realport\_ | Replaced with the real port variable from interlace                  |

# Usage Examples
## Run Nikto Over Multiple Sites
Let's assume that you had a file `targets.txt`  that had the following contents:

```
bugcrowd.com
hackerone.com
```
You could use interlace to run over any number of targets within this file using:
```
âžœ  /tmp interlace -tL ./targets.txt -threads 5 -c "nikto --host _target_ > ./_target_-nikto.txt" -v
==============================================
Interlace v1.0	by Michael Skelton (@codingo_)
==============================================
[14:33:23] [VERBOSE] [nikto --host hackerone.com > ./hackerone.com-nikto.txt] Added to Queue 
[14:33:23] [VERBOSE] [nikto --host bugcrowd.com > ./bugcrowd.com-nikto.txt] Added to Queue 
```
This would run nikto over each host and save to a file for each target. Note that in the above example since we're using the `>` operator so results won't be fed back to the terminal, however this is desired functionality as otherwise we wouldn't be able to attribute which target Nikto results were returning for.

## CIDR notation with an application that doesn't support it
Interlace automatically expands CIDR notation when starting threads (unless the --no-cidr flag is passed). This allows you to pass CIDR notation to a variety of applications:

To run a virtual host scan against every target within 192.168.12.0/24 using a direct command you could use:
```bash
interlace -t 192.168.12.0/24 -c "vhostscan $target -oN $output/$target-vhosts.txt" -o ~/scans/ -threads 50
```
This is despite VHostScan not having any inbuilt CIDR notation support. Since Interlace expands the notation before building a queue of threads, VHostScan for all intents is only receiving a list of direct IP addresses to scan.

## Threading Support for an application that doesn't support it
Run a [virtual host scan](https://github.com/codingo/VHostScan) against each host in a file (target-lst.txt), whilst also limiting scans at any one time to 50 maximum threads.

This could be done using a direct command:
```bash
interlace -tL ./target-list.txt -c "vhostscan -t $target -oN $output/$target-vhosts.txt" -o ~/scans/ -threads 50
```

Or, alternatively, to run the same command as above, but using a command file, this would be done using:
```bash
interlace -cL ./vhosts-commands.txt -tL ./target-list.txt -threads 50 -o ~/scans
```
This presumes that the contents of the command file is:
```
vhostscan -t $target -oN $output/$target-vhosts.txt
```

This would output a file for each target in the specified output folder. You could also run multiple commands simply by adding them into the command file.
